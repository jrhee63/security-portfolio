## ICMP Timestamp Request Vulnerability

Tool Used: Nessus  
Target: Rocky Linux (10.0.3.10)  
Scan Date: June 4, 2025  
Severity: Low

Nessus initially reported that the Rocky Linux VM was responding to ICMP timestamp requests, potentially allowing a remote attacker to infer system time and bypass time-based authentication.

Open services were reviewed on the system and unnecessary ones were removed.

ICMP timestamp requests and replies were blocked using firewall rules. These changes were then verified externally via:

```bash
nmap -sV -Pn 10.0.3.10
```

Only SSH remained accessible from the network.

To confirm that Nessus no longer detected the vulnerability, I performed a re-scan using the same scan policy.

The ICMP timestamp request vulnerability was no longer reported.

### June 4, 2025 â€“ Nessus Discovery and Hardening Validation

- Ran Nessus scan from Nessus VM to Rocky Linux target (10.0.3.10)
- Discovered ICMP timestamp response vulnerability
- Screenshot: `nessus-scan-icmp-timestamp.png`

- Reviewed public zone services:
```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services
```
- Screenshot: `rocky-open-services-before.png`

- Removed `cockpit` and `dhcpv6-client`
- Blocked ICMP timestamp-request and reply traffic using `firewall-cmd`
- Screenshot: `rocky-blocked-icmp-firewall.png`

- Ran `nmap -sV -Pn` from Kali to confirm only SSH (port 22) was reachable
- Screenshot: `nmap-after-hardening.png`

- Re-scanned target in Nessus to validate fix
- Screenshot: `nessus-rescan-clean.png`
- Nessus confirmed the vulnerability was no longer present

### Removing Unnecessary Services

Checked exposed services using:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services
```

Screenshot: `rocky-open-services-before.png`  
Found `cockpit` and `dhcpv6-client` enabled.

Removed both:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=cockpit
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --remove-service=dhcpv6-client
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

### Blocking ICMP Timestamp Requests

Blocked ICMP timestamp requests and replies:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-icmp-block=timestamp-request
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-icmp-block=timestamp-reply
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

---

### External Validation with Nmap

Used `nmap` to confirm that only SSH was accessible:

```bash
nmap -sV -Pn 10.0.3.10
```

### Final Validation via Nessus Re-scan

Re-ran Nessus scan to verify vulnerability was no longer detected.
